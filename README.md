# Secret Scrubland
[Live on Heroku](https://secret-scrubland-31430.herokuapp.com/)

A slapdash little web app that displays a heatmap calendar of how much time a Guardian has spent playing Destiny activities.

Built with Node.js, along with some vanilla JavaScript to power the front end.

`routes/index.js` expects a [Bungie API Key](https://www.bungie.net/en/User/API). You won't get far without one.
