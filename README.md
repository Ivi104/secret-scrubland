# Days Without Destiny
[dayswithoutdestiny.com](http://dayswithoutdestiny.com/)

A slapdash little web app that displays how many days a user has gone without playing Destiny.

Built with Node.js, along with some vanilla JavaScript to power the front end.

`routes/index.js` expects a [Bungie API Key](https://www.bungie.net/en/User/API). You won't get far without one.
